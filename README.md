### Professional Pitch

Hello, my name is James Ian Solima, I am an Army veteran with a Bachelorâ€™s Of Science in Information Technology. This is where I was exposed to different subjects of IT, databases and development. I have always had a fascination with technology and how it is constantly evolving to advance society which pushed me to teach myself some front end languages like HTML, CSS and Javascript. I continued to chase this fascination and advance my learning by going to a coding bootcamp called Sabio, where I learned full stack development with ASP.NET and C#. With this knowledge I was chosen amongst a team of 13 developers to help build a working MVP for a start-up called HubLink in 3 months. Since then, I have been working on an L2 Application Production Support team for Bank of America diagnosing, troubleshooting and improving enterprise applications. I am currently focused on learning the Python stack as I am interested in AI and machine learning. With my background I am able to stay resourceful, adaptable and persistent with learning new technologies and concepts to contribute innovation to any team I am a part of. Thanks for stopping by, hope to hear from you soon!

### What Excites Me About Tech

Some of the things that excite me the most about tech are the innovations they bring in hardware and in software such as self driving cars, smart appliances and AI in art, documentation and our everyday lives. I want to be able to contribute to the development of that kind of world where we can live alongside AI in a way that advances us. I also love video games and would like to create fun games on the side.

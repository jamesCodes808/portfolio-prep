## TO DO:

### About Me

- A two or three word catchy title. Do NOT use cliches like “programming ninja” or “coding rockstar”.
- A personal headline, like you have atop your LinkedIn page. What do you want your career to be about?
- Your professional pitch: You’ve done a recording, so just write down here how it goes.
- What excites you the most about tech? Write 1-2 sentences.

### Assets

- A headshot of your wonderful face, approximately 200x250 pixels.
- A background image, approximately 1500x700 pixels.
- At least three screenshots of the best-looking parts of a previous project, like your Code 201 final project.
- At least three screenshots each, of two other projects you have worked on. Salmon Cookies? Odd Duck?
